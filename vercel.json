}

### Notes on the Update
- **Removed `routes`**: The `"src": "/(.*)", "dest": "/"` route was removed to comply with Vercel’s configuration rules, as `headers` is present. Since this is a single-page Next.js app, the default routing (handled by `pages/index.jsx`) is sufficient, and no explicit `routes` are needed.
- **Kept `headers`**: The `headers` configuration ensures static assets (images, videos, and CSS) are cached for one year, optimizing performance.
- **Kept `builds`**: The `builds` section ensures Vercel recognizes the project as a Next.js app.

### Additional Steps to Ensure Fast Deployment
The `index.jsx` from the previous response is already optimized for fast Vercel deployment (pre-built Tailwind CSS, Next.js `<Image>`, ISR, etc.). To proceed:
1. **Use the Corrected `vercel.json`**:
   - Save the updated `vercel.json` (above) in your project root.
   - This ensures no configuration conflicts during deployment.
2. **Verify Assets**:
   - Ensure all referenced assets in `index.jsx` (e.g., `/greenline-logo-mark.webp`, `/landingvid.mp4`, etc.) exist in `/public`. Convert images to `.webp` and compress videos as described previously.
3. **Generate Tailwind CSS**:
   - Run `npx tailwindcss -i ./src/input.css -o ./public/styles.css --minify` to create `/public/styles.css`.
4. **Deploy**:
   - Commit and push changes:
     ```bash
     git add .
     git commit -m "Updated vercel.json and index.jsx for faster deployment"
     git push origin main
     ```
   - Deploy with:
     ```bash
     vercel --prod
     ```
   - Or let Vercel’s Git integration handle automatic deployment.
5. **Test**:
   - Check the Vercel deployment logs for errors.
   - Use Lighthouse to verify performance (aim for >90/100).
   - Ensure the form, images, and videos load correctly.

### If You Need `rewrites` or `redirects` Later
If you plan to add features like dynamic routes or redirects (e.g., for a multi-page site or URL aliases), you can include `rewrites` or `redirects` in `vercel.json`, but keep `routes` removed. For example, to redirect `/old-page` to `/`:
```json
{
  "redirects": [
    {
      "source": "/old-page",
      "destination": "/",
      "permanent": true
    }
  ]
}
```

If you’re sticking with a single-page app, the current `vercel.json` is sufficient. Let me know if you need help with asset preparation, form integration, or further Vercel configuration tweaks!
